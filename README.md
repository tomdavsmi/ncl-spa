An algorithmic solution to the Student Project Assignment problem, tailored for the CHY3011 module at Newcastle University. Primarily a Python port of https://github.com/richarddmorey/studentProjectAllocation, which is itself an implementation of Abraham et. al (2007) algorithm for allocating student projects. Please read the full paper for more information; 

Abraham, D.J., Irving, R.W., and Manlove, D.M. (2007) Two algorithms for the student-project allocation problem. Journal of Discrete Algorithms, 5(1), pp. 73-90. (doi:10.1016/j.jda.2006.03.006)

Added here is a more friendly input system which reads from an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and returns values to one. This is designed for use with Newcastle University's Forms system and so using another input format will requrie changes to the code.
